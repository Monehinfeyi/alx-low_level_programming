## SYNOPSIS

This directory contains some projects I worked on for African Leadership Academy. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:

> . What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation

> . What is malloc and free and how to use them

> . Why and when use malloc

> . How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## Description of what each file shows:

0 - A function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char

1 - A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter

2 - A function that concatenates two strings

3 - A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers

4 - A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function

5 - A function that concatenates all the arguments of your program
