## SYNOPSIS

This directory contains some projects I worked on with African Leadership Academy. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

# Description of what each file shows:                                                                                            

0 - A function that prints a string, followed by a new line (puts).   
                                                                                                            
1 - A function that prints a string in reverse.    

2 - A function that returns the length of a string            

3 - A function that returns the factorial of a given number.                                                                       
     
4 - A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y (pow).

5 - A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
                                                                        
6 - A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7 - A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
                                                                                                                                    
8 - A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
