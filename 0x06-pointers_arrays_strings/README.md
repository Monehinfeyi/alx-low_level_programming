# DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT EACH FILE DOES
0- The function concatenates two strings, appends the src string to the 'dest' string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of 'dest', and then adds a terminating null byte. Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

1- The function concatenates two strings. The '_strncat' function is similar to the '_strcat' function, except that
 . it will use at most n bytes from src; and
 . src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
 . Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.

2- The function that copies a string.

3- The function that compares two strings.

4- The function that reverses the content of an array of integers.Where n is the number of elements of the array.

5- The function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

6- The function that capitalizes all words of a string.Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }.

7- The function that encodes a string into 1337.
 . Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
